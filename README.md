# Trevi's Repair Tool
My own extension for [r/TronScript](https://old.reddit.com/r/TronScript/).

> **Note**: features\
> For now, this is just an _extension_ for TronScript because the only new stuff is the addition of rebooting in normal mode before starting TronScript and resetting EXE file associations to their default (e.g. Axam worm). This extension is currently incomplete and might not work properly.

To download it, click Code, and then Download ZIP, or use [this link](https://github.com/aritz331/TreviAV/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

> **Warning**: you must download Tron separately for now. I'll make the script download TronScript automatically soon.
